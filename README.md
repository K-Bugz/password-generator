# K-Bugz Password generator

K-Bugz secure password generator with editable parameter setting. You need a password, I have got you! This password generator allows you to pick parameters and length. 

## Description

üîê This repository contains the completed code for a password generator project requested by an anonymous client. This project began from a starter code file graciously provided by the UT Austin Full-Stack Coding Boot Camp. Our user story here is about an employee with access to lots of sensitive data, in need of a program to generate strong passwords in order to provide greater security.

üèóÔ∏è The provided starter code took care of the basic process of rendering whatever text I wanted to generate in my generatePassword() function, but that was about it. Aside from a couple variables, an undeclared function, an event listener, and a few query selectors there was nothing provided in the way of actually generating the password.
